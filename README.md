# Laserdome
The purpose of this project is to provide insight into the design of a laser tag system, which includes two setups of a weapon and a vest. This laser tag system supports 15 player identities, each of which emits a unique signal when shooting the weapon. The signals are infrared and use a carrier frequency of 38 kHz. The carrier wave is modulated with a 833 Hz bit stream, which represents the specific user. A message consists of 13 bits. The first 8 bits make up the start sequence, followed by 4 data bits and a final stop bit. The start sequence is identical for all user identities, and is there to decrease the chance of registering false hits, caused by sudden movements in front of the vest. If the diode on the weapon successfully hits the receiver diode on the vest, the receiver diode filters out the carrier wave, the remaining bit stream is decoded, and the player ID of the shooter is stored on the FPGA board. There are two hit points, one on the vest and one on the weapon. The one on the vest registers a normal hit and the one on the weapon registers a critical hit. If a player gets hit, their weapon will be deactivated for either 10 or 20 seconds, depending on weather the hit was normal or critical. The shooter receives one point for a normal hit, and two points for a critical hit. When a laser tag game is finished, the stored hits can be sent from the FPGA board to a PC, where a scoreboard is generated.
